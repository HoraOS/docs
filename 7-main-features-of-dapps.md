# 7 .Main features of Dapps

### **1. Transparency**

**•** DeFi offers the world a new level of transparency. Since most of DeFi applications work on public blockchains like Ethereum and Tron, all transactions are publicly available. In fact, all activities on blockchain are public. The main difference in this approach compared to traditional bank accounts is that the accounts are not tied directly to anyone. Instead, the accounts are pseudo-anonymous and only list one numeric address.

• In particular, although accounts are not directly linked to anyone's name, there are ways for researchers to find out who owns them if asked. Programs like block explorer can help people track and track the decentralized transactions of privacy-focused coins.

### **2. Open source**

The DeFi application must be open source. Open source refers to the fact that encryption is public. This way anyone can test it and validate its functionality, security, and capabilities. Open source is much more stable and secure than native code because of this community interaction. Additionally, it provides more confidence in the platform as users can rest assured that no hidden malicious code is active in the background.

### **3 .Greater access to financial services globally**

Dapps represent scalability in the way that developers envision financial platforms. Anyone from all over the world can join the DeFi platform. You just need a smartphone with internet access and you can join the DeFi community in minutes.

As a result, DeFi Dapps has the potential to provide those without banks around the world access to financial services for the first time in recorded history. This openness is a huge upgrade over the current banking system, where about 40% of the global population does not have any form of banking.

Importantly, when you think about bankless populations, you can easily picture a village somewhere in the tropics or a desert, but the reality is much different. For example, a recent study found that 25% of US households still do not have a bank. It is in these positions that DeFi has an immediate effect.
