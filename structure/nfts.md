# NFTs

 A **non-fungible token** \(**NFT**\) is a unit of data stored on a digital [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger), called a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), that certifies a [digital asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset) to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#cite_note-:32-1) NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of [ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership) that is separate from [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright).
