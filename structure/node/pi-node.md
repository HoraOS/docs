# PI Node

It is a child node extending from Adamas node to manage user address data integrated on mobile devices with small capacity, low processing capacity. Pi nodes form a metadata management network that protects user data and increases data processing performance on mobile devices. Pi nodes are operated on a secondary protocol that connects to the main network via a bridge.
