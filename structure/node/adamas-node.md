Contains the core of Hora OS. These nodes are responsible for managing computer resources, computing and tokenizing the resources of computers where the node is installed, and connecting to the global network, in order to optimize the distribution of computing resources. Adamas nodes combine into a decentralized cloud computing network called Adamas Cloud. These nodes also support validate transactions of tokens and recording to the blockchain, built on the source code of OpenEthereum, called Hora Chain. Adamas node relies on computing resources of computers that have joined the network to return rewards and collect user fees.
