# IPFS

The **InterPlanetary File System** \(**IPFS**\) is a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol) and [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) network for storing and sharing data in a [distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_file_system). IPFS uses [content-addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) to uniquely identify each file in a [global namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Namespace) connecting all computing devices.
