# 2. Defi Bank

DeFi platforms are fast becoming one of the most used Dapps in the blockchain ecosystem. The more people discovering alternative investment strategies, the more popular the DeFi movement will become. The potential for decentralized finance to compete with traditional banks is enormous. There are many services that could be interrupted. Hopefully, in the future, you will not need a bank to act as a middleman for all of your investment needs. Alternatives are coming, especially for those who don't have banks.
