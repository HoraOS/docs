# POS

**Proof of stake**\(PoS\) is a method of securing a [cryptocurrency](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) network through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from [proof-of-work](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Proof-of-work) systems that run hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. It is most commonly used as a supplement to [proof-of-work](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Proof-of-work) in [Peercoin](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Peercoin) and a few other electronic currencies.
