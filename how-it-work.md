# How it work?

Peers participating in the AdamasCloud computing network make part of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth, available directly to other network participants without need central coordination of server or stable server. Peers are both providers and consumers of resources. 

These resources are tokenized to distribute costs between resource providers and users, thereby forming a decentralized economy based on sharing resources through the internet.
